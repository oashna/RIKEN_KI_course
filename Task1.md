# 1. Medical relevant insight

This publication is part of the FANTOM6 project in RIKEN, which focuses
on studying the function of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the human
genome.

The study knocked down 285 lncRNAs in human dermal fibroblasts and
identified lncRNAs that, when depleted, alter transcriptional programs
and cellular behaviors (proliferation, morphology, senescence-like
signatures).

The authors then highlight the functional roles for two lncRNAs,
ZNF213-AS1 and lnc-KHDC3L-2, of which the transcriptional changes link
to biological pathways and processes that are often implicated diseases,
such as cancer.

The paper also provides a public lncRNA knockdown dataset with molecular
phenotyping that enables linking lncRNAs to disease-associated genes for
further downstream analysis.
